# Heart Disease Prediction (XGBoost + FastAPI)

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training (XGBoost)
- Model evaluation (precision, recall, F1)
- Model deployment with FastAPI

## Project Structure
├── data/         # Dataset (heart.csv)
├── notebooks/    # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and testing
├── src/          # Training, preprocessing, prediction scripts
├── api/          # FastAPI app for deployment
├── model/        # Saved model (model.pkl)
├── README.md     # You’re here!
## Next Steps

1. Explore the data in `notebooks/eda.ipynb`
2. Refactor code into `src/`
3. Train and save model
4. Serve with FastAPI
